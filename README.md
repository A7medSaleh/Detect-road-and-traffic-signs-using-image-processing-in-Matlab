In this code I use many image processing and image segmentation techniques to detect road and traffic signs in any images using Matlab. Also the code segment out the sign part which can be then used with machine learning classifier to get the sign type.

What is nice about this code is that it is fast and requires no training what so ever it is direct image processing with no complex slow machine learning techniques however it is also very accurate. 

The code is commented in details at each line to know the idea and algorithm used in it.
